<h1>Hi, I'm <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/public-profile/settings?trk=d_flagship3_profile_self_view_public_profile">Jordan West</a>,  I'm looking to join a team where I can contribute meaningfully, grow alongside experienced professionals, and help strengthen an organization’s security posture from day one.

My focus areas include log analysis, vulnerability management, and security frameworks like NIST and ISO 27001. I’ve applied tools such as Tenable, Nessus, and Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (MDE) in hands-on projects to identify vulnerabilities, assess risks, and enhance endpoint security. I’m working toward certifications to validate what I’m already practicing. I take pride in learning fast, staying level-headed under pressure, and asking the right questions.

Disciplined, adaptable, and eager to grow in cybersecurity. I'm pursuing entry-level roles in GRC or SOC analysis. I bring a military background, a calm mindset, and a strong desire to learn.
