.USAGE
    Run this script as an administrator to configure ELAM to only allow good, unknown, and critical drivers â€” excluding known bad drivers.
    Example:
    PS C:\> .\Configure-ELAM-DriverPolicy.ps1
#>

# Define registry path
$regPath = "HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Policies\EarlyLaunch"

# Create the registry key if it does not exist
if (-not (Test-Path $regPath)) {
    New-Item -Path $regPath -Force | Out-Null
}

# Set DriverLoadPolicy to 3 (Good, Unknown, and Bad but Critical)
New-ItemProperty -Path $regPath -Name "DriverLoadPolicy" -PropertyType DWord -Value 3 -Force | Out-Null

Write-Host "DriverLoadPolicy has been configured to 3 (secure startup enforcement) successfully." -ForegroundColor Green
